## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

Each folder in this repository is dedicated to a specific topic or project from the course. Inside each folder, you will find:
-   **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`)** with the implementation of the algorithms.
-   **A `data` subfolder** containing any datasets used.
-   **A `report.pdf` or `report.md`** file explaining the approach, results, and conclusions for the project.

To run the code, you will need to install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
